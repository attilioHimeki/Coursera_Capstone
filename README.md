## Introduction/Business Problem
House prices in Berlin have gone up dramatically in the last few years. This presents a critical challenge for policy makers and the general population. One of the main culprit is often said to be short lets.

The purpose of this notebook is to give an overview of all areas in Berlin, and finding out what factors are most relevant when determining a dramatic change in prices. This will help figuring out which area in Berlin may be most convenient to move in for a young professional and for other cohorts, and which area has the highest potential for return on investment for real estate purchase.

## Data
I will be leveraging the Foursquare API to provide geolocation information about the different boroughs of Berlin.

For this analysys, we'll look at the difference in pricing for short lets in each area, and then correlate that with the venues and facilities available. AirBnb prices tend to affect house prices in a particular area, so this will be one of the data sources I will be using. InsideAirbnb provides a dataset of listings for Berlin, including prices, area, and type of listing.

The amount of venues in an area, especially restaurants and cafes, also tends to be an indicator of a popular area, as well as offices, tech companies. For this, I will be using the Foursquare datasets.

Proximity to public transport, availability of services and facilities and schools are also factors to be taken into account. This data will be retrieved using the Foursquare API.
